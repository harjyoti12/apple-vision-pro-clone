This project is a clone of the Apple Vision Pro website's frontend, created as a part of a web development learning experience. The goal of this project is to practice and showcase skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also exploring the use of advanced animation libraries such as Locomotive Scroll, ScrollTrigger, and GSAP.

Key Features
Responsive Design: The website is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction experience across a wide range of devices.

Animations: Locomotive Scroll, ScrollTrigger, and GSAP are used to create smooth and engaging animations, enhancing the visual appeal and user experience of the website.

Interactive Elements: Interactive elements such as buttons, sliders, and scrolling effects are implemented to provide a dynamic and immersive browsing experience.


## Built With
